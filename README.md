# Fn App Example

This shows you how to organize functions into a full application and deploy them easily with one command.

Assuming you have an Fn server running, just clone this repo, cd into it then run:

```sh
fn deploy --all
```

Then surf to http://localhost:8080/r/helloapp

See [apps documentation](https://github.com/fnproject/fn/blob/master/docs/developers/apps.md) for more details on applications.
